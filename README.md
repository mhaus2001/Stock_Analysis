# Stock_Analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a data set which showcases the preformacne of stocks over the years of 2017 and 2018 so at to judge them. So the code we created served to analyze and compile the data from these sets in order to showcase the preformance of stocks in as effiecnt way as we could. Therefore we created code in VBA in order to create a compilation of the data for the stocks of each year so that a person could choose a year and then from there see all the data compiled in an easy and quick to use manner.

## Results

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages of refartering code is that it can make code more effiecent in how it completes its assigned task and in doing reduce the time, and as well make it easier to understand as it is much more clear in how it is coded to carry out the assigned task. However there are downsides to this, those being that while in making changes to the code new bugs could occur and make it so the code no longer can carry out its assigned function.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
